                Tensions were high, and it was time to put everything together and show it off to the class. My partner and I went through and made a bunch of revisions to our ending and other areas we felt were weak so we could have something presentable to the class. We fixed what we could and turned in our treatment items with bated breath as we waited for what was sure to be an awful experience.

                Now this, this made me EXTATIC. All that worrying was for nothing, because as it turned out people actually really liked our screenplay. We got some good feedback on some things we needed to change, like a few formal sentences here and some awkward lines there, but other than that our screenplay seemed to be a hit! This dispelled just about any fears I had about turning this thing in and also solidified in my mind that writing wasnâ€™t just a chore, but something I loved.
