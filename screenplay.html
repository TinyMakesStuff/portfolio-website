                Alright, here we are, the final draft. This is what the whole class has been leading up to, so there was no room for failure. Let me tell ya, even though we had all that good feedback turning this thing in was a nightmare. While that whole bit about all our fears being gone was true, it just didn't last long. We were so scared that Giles wouldnâ€™t like our screenplay or that there was some tiny bit of incorrect grammar we missed that we ended up submitting the thing five minutes before the deadline. But once we did, it sent a wave of relief over us as we realized: we had done it. We had graduated from timid writing students to real, confident writers.
