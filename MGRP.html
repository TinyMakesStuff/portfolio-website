                Thankfully, this was the easy part of the project. All I had to do was throw what I wrote into some canva templates and just edit them together to make them somewhat coherent. However, this did end up teaching me how important consistency is. If all my “articles” didn’t fit the theming of the magazine, it would break the flow and immersion of the project, so learning to write consistently was a must that helped a bunch with writing things like characters for my later projects.

                Now THIS part I never want to think about again. I was ripping my hair out trying to get all the physical parts done; my 3d printer jammed like 4 times, the box and cards (including the art and lamination) all had to be done the day before we had to turn these in, heck I even had to scrap several pieces because they broke and I just didn’t have the time to 3d print them again. One week did NOT feel like enough time to comfortably get all of this done, and from that point on I made sure not to let my ambition get the better of me and made sure to work within my limits.

                How was that, was it convincing enough? Yeah, that whole ambition thing is a loada bs. I mean, come on, Giles expected us to write 6 fully fleshed out pieces, make a high-quality display with a matching theme for each of the said pieces, AND do it all in basically one week? How were we supposed to do this WITHOUT destroying our sleep schedule?! Man, I hated this assignment, it was easily the low point of the class.
