                Alright, here we are, this is what the entirety of unit two has been leading up to. I had a lot of fun teaming up with my twin to write this one, I really learned just how enjoyable it is to collaborate with and bounce ideas off of others. And presenting this thing to the class was a really memorable experience for me. I put a lot of myself into Take a Number, with a lot of lines from our antagonist, Martin, coming from things people have actually told me. So to see the rest of the class respond in what seemed to be a positive way and even talk/joke about it once we were finished presenting it just made me so happy. It made me think for the first time that maybe I might actually be good at writing. It wasâ€¦ encouraging.
