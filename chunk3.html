                    Well, guess who wasn’t here for this one? Me!  Whoo hoo, sort of vacation!!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Yeah I was out at the Technology Student Association state conference in Athens, Georgia that entire week, so I had NO time to get any writing done. But it was pretty sweet, I got to hang out with my friends, explore Athens, and compete in this board game competition with a project I had been working on for nearly a year at that point. While I didn’t end up winning (rigged), I had a blast and its up there as one of my favorite high school memories ever.  
                    <br><br>
                    But work on the screenplay still had to get done. And while I was at Athens, my lovely partner was hard at work adding onto our screenplay. I had to put a lot of trust that they would actually get it done, and thankfully that trust was rewarded. They got the next bit of screenplay done, and I learned that I really can trust my partner.
