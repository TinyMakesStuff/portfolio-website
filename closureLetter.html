                Dear reader, 
                <br><br>
                So, dramatic writing, huh? What an experience that was. Ya'know, I originally signed up for this thing because I want to go into game design, not because I wanted to be a writer or something like that. While I did have a passing interest in writing, I thought that some experience with storytelling would probably be useful so my games wouldn’t be as dull as a rock. 
                <br><br>
	            Honestly, I kind of regretted signing up for this class at first. I had this feeling, deep down, that I was a fraud. That in coming into this class without a true passion for writing, me and things I write would just automatically be inferior to the works of everyone else. 
                <br><br>
	            And that fear was only heightened by the fact that I’m not a very social person. I really struggle with getting outside my comfort zone and talking to new people, so learning that I would be spending the year in a class with people I barely know AND have to get in front of everybody and read what I wrote was just mortifying to me.  
                <br><br>
	            I mean, for our first feather circle, I was literally SHAKING at the idea of having to read what I wrote Infront of everyone when the talking stick made its way around to me. I vividly remember my first few attempts at trying to start, I kept trying to start reading but the words just wouldn’t come out. 
                <br><br>
	            But the magic thing about dramatic writing is that it doesn’t let you stay silent. If you don’t read, you don’t get a grade.  
                <br><br>
	            And so I read. I went against everything my body was telling me and read with everything I had in me. But, to my surprise, I didn’t completely hate it. No, on the contrary, I actually kind of LIKED it. 
                <br><br>
	            Without having to get in front of everyone and read like that, I don’t think I would have ever found a passion for writing. I no longer felt like an outsider after that, and I was excited to get back to writing. 
                <br><br>
	            And get back to writing I did. With each feather circle I grew to love the craft more and more, with my feelings only being solidified when we got to our 7th and final feather circle: teenage monologue. 
                <br><br>
	            That monologue was my absolute favorite memory from this class. Getting to get up there, put a dunce cap on the teacher and hear everyone’s laughter at each of my jokes just sent this rush through me that I ADORED. I was honestly pretty disappointed that we were done with feather circles after that. 
                <br><br>
	            Honestly, without this class I think I’d probably be in a much worse position. Without it, I wouldn’t have had that little push to teach me that stepping out of your comfort zone and sharing your work with others is actually fun. I think it’s going to be something I carry with me for the rest of my life. No longer will I make things and never let others see. No longer will I be scared of criticism. No longer will I be afraid to express myself. 
                <br><br>
	            So, I’m glad I took this class. With my newfound love of writing and willingness to share, I can’t wait to show the world what I make next.
